# LinkedList, Stack and Queue

## Overview
This is a project which contains three kinds of data structure:<br>

- LinkedList<br>
- Stack<br>
- Queue

All of these structures work with `Nodes`. A node is a unit that has a value `Data` and a link `Reference` to the next node. 

This was pratice project in python. The goal was to understand and pratice these data structure.
I added a test file and lot of print() statments along the codes to check each function.

## The Project
### LinkedList
A linkedList is a linear collection, sequence of nodes. 

Functions in the LinkedList:<br>
Get head node<br>
Get last node<br>
Insert Beginning<br>
Insert End<br>
String LinkedList<br>
Remove Node<br>
Replace Node<br>
Count LinkedList<br>
Sum All Nodes<br>
Reverse LinkedList

### Stack
A Stack is a data sctructure that follows the <strong>first in, last out</strong> (FILO) principle.

Functions in the Stack:<br>
Push<br>
Pop<br>
Peek<br>
Has Space<br>
Is Empty<br>
Get Size<br>
Get Name<br>
Print Stack

### Queue
A Queue follows the <strong>first in, first out</strong> (FIFO) principle.

Functions in the Queue:<br>
Enqueue<br>
Dequeue<br>
Peek<br>
Print Queue<br>
Get Size<br>
Has Space<br>
Is Empty
